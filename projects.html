    <div id="supermileage1" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">One of my proudest accomplishments during my time at Michigan Tech is my participation in the Supermileage Systems Enterprise. During my time with Supermileage, I have been responsible for assembling large, comprehensive documents addressed to the competition executives for the competitions we participate in. The documents covered important details about the vehicle, such as weight, materials, safety features, electrical systems, and numerous others.<br>
		I also had an opportunity to create a welcome document, to be distributed to new joiners to our enterprise, outlining their duties and responsibilities as part of the team, as well as where they could go for help in the likely event of confusion down the road. This document can be viewed <a href="#">here</a></div>

    <div id="supermileage2" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">During my very first semester at school, I worked as part of a student team to help advertise a program, which was known at the time as the International Graduate Teaching Assistant Assistance Program (IGTAAP). The program has since been renamed. Our team sat down with the client, the director of the program, to get an idea of what was needed. Through our brief interview with her, we, in competition with other teams, created a tri-fold pamphlet. The client was immensley pleased with our work. The pamphlet can be viewed <a href="portfolio/Trifold Brochure.pdf">here</a>.</div>

    <div id="supermileage3" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">During my first two years, I dedicated a lot of my time to participating in the student governments on campus. My participation was through the Douglass Houghton Hall Council, which was responsible for the management and events in the residence hall I lived in. For each of the four semesters I participated, I held a position of minor importance within the council, rising as high as becoming Vice-president. During my time, I had an opportunity to learn important skills such as working as part of a team of people, creating and balancing a budget, following Robert's Rules of Order, and organizing a weekly event for the people of the residence hall over the course of the year.</div>
